# libtropic-linux

This repository contains examples of the official SDK [libtropic](https://github.com/tropicsquare/libtropic)'s usage on Linux-based platforms.

Contributors, please follow the [guidelines](https://github.com/tropicsquare/libtropic-linux/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

 > [!IMPORTANT]
 > Example projects in separate folders represent different hardware connections for TROPIC01. They all wrap [libtropic](https://github.com/tropicsquare/libtropic) and are ready to be compiled and executed in a Linux environment.

## Supported Hardware

[Tropic Square](https://www.tropicsquare.com) provides [TROPIC01](https://www.tropicsquare.com/tropic01) not only as a **silicon chip** but also as **various shields** and **devkits**, so the building instructions differ.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We strongly recommend reading the [Libtropic SDK documentation](https://tropicsquare.github.io/libtropic/latest/) to familiarize yourself with the basic concepts and then going through the First Steps as described in each guide in the following list, where you will be introduced to basic examples and will you update your chip's firmware.
 
Choose the instructions based on the hardware you want to use:
* [Linux SPI](./Linux_SPI/README.md) (compatible with our [Raspberry Pi shield](https://github.com/tropicsquare/tropic01-raspberrypi-shield-hw))
* [USB devkit TS1302](./TS1302_devkit/README.md) (compatible with our [USB devkit](https://github.com/tropicsquare/tropic01-stm32u5-usb-devkit-hw))
